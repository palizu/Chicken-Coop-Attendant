        Introducing Chicken Coop Attendant!</h1>

        <td width="620" valign="top"><h4> Welcome to the 21st century and the world's first &quot;Smart Chicken Coop!&quot;</h4>
          <p>Chicken Coop Attendant goes far beyond a way to simply automate opening and closing the coop door. Chicken Coop Attendant (CCA) is designed to work in harmony with sunrise and sunset. A delay can  be set to adjust the opening and closing times. For example, you might want the door to open 10 minutes before sunrise and close 15 minutes after sunset. Infra-red sensors detect a chicken left outside after the door closes and immediately send a text message to alert you of this condition.</p>
          <p> Obviously, some CCA features require a network connection (e.g. email and remote access) but things like knowing when sunrise and sunset will occur are built into the system. Once the GPS coordinates are loaded during the initial setup process the door automation is completely autonomous.</p>
          <p>The Android remote interface can be seen in the slide-show here. This powerful feature allows control and management of the coop from anywhere in the world using your  cell phone. CCA also comes with a built-in Web interface that not only controls the coop but also has up to 3 webcams.</p>
          <p>How about being able to control a heat panel or fan based on the temperature of the coop? For example, you might want the heater to turn on when the coop temperature falls to 15º and turn off when the coop temperature reaches 20º. No problem. Just set it and forget it!</p>
          <p>The security feature built into CCA is second to none. Within seconds of a predator detection, your cell phone sounds an alarm alerting you of the danger at the coop. Never again will you wake to find one or all of your feathered friends were a midnight snack for a hungry varmint. We have been told this feature alone makes CCA worth every penny. Go to our video section to see more information on the CCA security feature.</p>
          <p>When we said this was a &quot;Smart Chicken Coop&quot; we weren't kidding! CCA even has the ability to play soothing classical music. This has been proven by many studies to promote egg production and overall well-being. Our girls definitely seem to like being serenaded while they sleep.<br />
            <br />
            A great deal of attention to detail was given to every aspect of the CCA system. Written in modern-day Java and C languages and compiled into binary executable files, CCA is fast, scalable and reliable.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Note: If you want to stop the slide-show on a slide to see the detail of that slide, simply move your mouse pointer over the slide-show. While on the slide-show you can click the mouse to advance to the next slide or move your mouse pointer off the slide-show to resume automatic mode.</strong></em></p></td>

	      Make your coop a Smart Coop!</h1><br />
        Our plug and play kit is designed to turn any coop into a smart coop. All components and cables are pre-built and included with the kit (minus the door rails). Simply mount the control unit anywhere in the coop, run your pre-built cables, plug them in and your done. It couldn't be easier! Please see our short video below or go to our <a href="photo_gallery.php">photo gallery</a> for a few closeup pictures of the new kit.
<table><tr>
        <td height="402"> <ul>
          <li><strong>Kit Includes</strong>- Our kits include the control unit with software. All switches, sensors, door motor, mounting hardware and pre-built cables. Even the coop door is included.</li>
          <li><strong>Controlled 110 volt Devices</strong>- The standard outlet seen on the left is designed to control lights and an optional devcie such as heater or fan.</li>
          <li><strong>Webcam and Music</strong>- The USB port and 3.5&quot; stereo port in the center are where you can attach a webcam and speakers. With the webcam you can keep an eye on the girls using our new web-based interface. CCA can also connect to network cameras.</li>
          <li><strong>Cat5 Connectors  -</strong> All sensors and switches connect to the control unit using Cat5 connectors. This makes plugging your devices in as easy as plugging a phone into a wall outlet.</li>
          <li><strong>Motor Connector</strong> - The door motor is a 2-wire device that takes a bit more current than the switches and sensors. For this reason we used a push-pin connector similar to a speaker connection. It can be seen on the bottom row of the connector plate.</li>
          <li><strong>Price</strong> - The complete kit pre-configured to your specifications is $399.00. Installation support is included at no charge!</li>

	    Building your own smart copp can be a fun project. We have developed a document to guide you through the whole process.
	    <table><tr>
         <td valign="top"><p>CCA is offered as both the coplete kit and the software only. The software only option will require you to build your own smart coop. While this may seem a daunting task, our documentation and accompanying videos will make the job easy and fun.</p>
           <p>The software will be provided on a bootable micro-sd card. It will be virtually ready to use when placed in a Raspberry Pi computer. The Raspberry Pi and all other needed components can be purchased on-line. Some items can be purchased locally.</p>
           <p>The cost for the software pre-loaded on a 16gb micro-SD card is  $49.00. Shipping is free within the Continental U.S. Taxes will be collected on orders within Tennessee.</p>
           <p>The Android app that controls CCA is available for free on the Google Play store. Simply visit the Google Play Store and search for 'Chicken Coop Attendant'.</p>
           <p>We welcome anyone to visit us and get an on-site demo of the CCA system. Just send us a message and we will schedule an appointment and give you directions to our farm located in Corryton Tennessee.</p></td>
